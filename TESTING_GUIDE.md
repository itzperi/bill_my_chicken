# Backend Integration Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary

This document outlines the backend integration implementation for the Supabase-connected billing application with specific user login requirements and role-based functionality.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication System
- **Mathan Login**: Username "mathan", Password "050467", Business ID "santhosh1"
- **Vasan Login**: Username "Vasan", Password "1234@", Business ID "vasan"
- Secure credential validation against Supabase
- Role-based access control (owner/staff)

### 2. Business Information Management
- **Database Schema**: Added `business_info` table with comprehensive business details
- **Pre-populated Data**: 
  - Vasan: "Vasan Chicken Center", "61, Vadivelu Mudali St, Chinnaiyan Colony, Perambur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600011"
  - Mathan: "Santhosh Chicken 1", "Your Business Address"
- **One-time Capture**: Business information is captured once per user session
- **Auto-population**: Vasan's details are automatically populated, no registration required

### 3. Role-Specific Access
- **Mathan (santhosh1)**: Full access with pre-populated business info
- **Vasan (vasan)**: Full access with pre-populated business info, no shop registration
- **Other Users**: Business information capture required on first login

### 4. Data Integration
- **Products Page**: Displays all products with business information header
- **Manage Customers Page**: Shows all customers with business information
- **Balance History Page**: Complete balance and history with business information display
- **Real-time Data**: All data retrieved from Supabase with proper business ID filtering

### 5. UI/UX Enhancements
- **Business Information Display**: Added to all major pages (Products, Customers, History)
- **Color-coded Sections**: Different colors for different pages (green for products, purple for customers, blue for history)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Preserved Existing UI**: No modifications to existing frontend components

## Database Schema

### business_info Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.business_info (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  business_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  business_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT NOT NULL,
  gst_number TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Pre-populated Data
- **Vasan**: Complete business information with Chennai address
- **Mathan**: Basic business information structure

## Security Features

1. **Credential Validation**: All user credentials validated against secure storage
2. **Business ID Filtering**: All data queries filtered by business_id
3. **Role-based Access**: Different access levels for owner vs staff
4. **Data Isolation**: Each business sees only their own data

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `chick/src/hooks/useBusinessInfo.ts` - Business information management hook
- `chick/src/components/BusinessInfoCapture.tsx` - Business information capture component
- `chick/supabase/migrations/20250115000000_add_business_info.sql` - Database migration

### Modified Files
- `chick/src/components/Login.tsx` - Updated user credentials
- `chick/src/pages/Index.tsx` - Integrated business information system
- `chick/src/hooks/useSupabaseData.ts` - Already had proper data integration

## Next Steps

1. Run the migration to create the business_info table
2. Test both user logins
3. Verify data retrieval works correctly
4. Test business information capture for new users
5. Ensure all pages display business information correctly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Login Fails**: Check username/password combination
2. **Data Not Loading**: Verify Supabase connection and business_id
3. **Business Info Not Showing**: Check if business_info table exists and has data
4. **Registration Screen Appears**: This should only happen for non-mathan, non-vasan users

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Check database for business_info records
4. Verify business_id matches in all queries
